# Request router that uses consistent hashing

## About

**Router** provides a way to register host instances with varying weights,
used to determine how many replicas are placed on a logical "hash ring."

## TODO
1. Select test framework (likely catch2)
2. Write tests to validate stable routing, minimal re-routes, memory leaks.
